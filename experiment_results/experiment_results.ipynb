    "Shapelet-based techniques can roughly be divided up into the following categories. Shapelet Discovery approaches [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], Learning Shapelets approaches [7, 8], and hybrid approaches [9, 10] whereas hybrid approaches combine ideas from the other two categories. The learning shapelets approach shows a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. One reason for that might be its capability to learn shapelets, which must not be directly part of the time-series dataset. Since shapelet discovery approaches use subsequences from the dataset, they do not offer such a capability. Unfortunately, this extra capability of the learning shapelets approaches can lead to learning of shapelets, which poorly approximate patterns found in the dataset. Shapelets which poorly approximate patterns of the dataset loose their interpretability. On the contrary, we refer to shapelets as 'realistic' if they closely approximate actual patterns in the dataset. Shapelet discovery approaches by definition fullfil the property to be realistic because the shapelets are directly sampled from the dataset. Figure 1 shows a sample of learned shapelets with *Learning Shapelets* [7] on the left, which illustrates the difficulty of the appoach to come up with realistic shapelets. On the right, an alternative loss function $\\mathcal{L_R}$ (which we will introduce below) forcing the shapelets to better approximate patterns of the dataset. "

    "To alleviate the difficulty of the *Learning Shapelets* approach to produce realistic shapelets, Wang et al. [8] propose \"Learning Interpretable Shapelets through  Adversarial Regularization\". The approach uses an additional network with a similar structure than the *Learning Shapelets* model, which shall serve as a judge to evaluate if the learned shapelets resemble patterns from the data. The two networks share the parameters for the shapelets and are trained alternatingly. We found a simpler way to force *Learning Shapelets* to learn more realistic patterns via simpler regularization terms. A very similar regularization was found by Kidger et al. in [11].
